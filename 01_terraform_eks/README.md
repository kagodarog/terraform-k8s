# Basic provisioning of EKS with Terraform

You can provision a basic EKS cluster with Terraform with the following commands:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

It might take a while for the cluster to be creates (up to 15-20 minutes).

As soon as cluster is ready, you should find a `kubeconfig_my-cluster` kubeconfig file in the current directory.

# Deploy metrics server to EKS since it isn't deployed by default

wget -O v0.3.6.tar.gz https://codeload.github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/tar.gz/v0.3.6 && tar -xzf v0.3.6.tar.gz

kubectl apply -f metrics-server-0.3.6/deploy/1.8+/

# deploy the aws load balancer controller with helm
helm repo add eks https://aws.github.io/eks-charts
kubectl apply -k "github.com/aws/eks-charts/stable/aws-load-balancer-controller//crds?ref=master"
helm install aws-load-balancer-controller eks/aws-load-balancer-controller --set clusterName=my-cluster -n kube-system
